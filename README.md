# SortAndSearchConsoleApp

This is a console application implemented in C++. It demonstrates sorting of an unordered list of numbers and search of
certain element from sorted lists.

As the first step, the user must enter how many numbers does he want to enter into the list and then he makes an entry.
The unordered list of numbers prints on screen with enquiry about sorting method. User can choose between Bubble sort,
Shell sort, Insertion sort or Selection sort. After the execution of choosen sorting method, user can see the ordered
list and enter which number does he seeks in the list. As a result, the program returns the exact position of searched element
form orderd list. The search algorithm implemented is binary search.

Each sorting and search function is written separately according to pseudocode without using the C++ algorithm library.
